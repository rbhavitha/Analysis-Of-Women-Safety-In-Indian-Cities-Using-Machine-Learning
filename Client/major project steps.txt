Firstly open PyCharm.This is the best 
IDE  for any sort python development
To run the project server use command 
python manage.py run server

Now,we will get url when the project is successfully compiled,
Then enter the portid in any browser

This is the MAIN HOME PAGE OF OUR PROJECT

As it is common when 
we develop a web appilication,we 
need to maintain database.
Here we used WampServer for maintaining
database
 






Now,getting back to our home page,
Here if you don't have any account 
then sign up





A new user got registered,let us see in 
the database if it is stored.







If user already have an account,then 
user can login by entering correct
log in credentials.



In UPDATE DETAILS PAGE,if user want 
to change any personal information,
she can change it here.



Here comes the main page,UPLOAD TWEET,
User can freely share their experience,
or opinions about Indian Cities



Now let's go to admin block




Here admin can see all the details of
registered user




Admin analyzes the huge amount of data
obtained from tweets shared everyday.
The classified data is represented
in form of graph.


This project provides immediate 
change in graph after uploading tweets.
Based on this anlaysis graph one can get
an idea about the status of women
safety in Indian Cities.
